                        This project used a MongoDB database in order to store and retrieve user generated "thoughts".
                        The thoughts were displayed underneath the text entry box, and there was no way to know who posted it. Scary.<br>

                        The website is long dead. You can try visit it if you want, but the Cloud Run instances are set to deny all traffic.<br>
